description: An introduction to the serverless .NET website.
---

Why hello there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to serverlessdotnet.dev. I'm guessing you're here to learn about all of the wonderful things you can build using .NET on AWS serverless technologies.

Whether you are brand new to serverless development or a seasoned professional this site has a little bit of everything. 

I'd recommend starting with the [Your First Lambda](./docs/category/your-first-lambda) tutorial first. From there, feel free to have a look around.

If you'd like to contribute or noticed one of my inevitable spelling mistakes then please raise an issue on the GitHub repo.

Otherwise, happy coding! 

James
