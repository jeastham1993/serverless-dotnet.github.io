## Trigger AWS Lambda from an S3 event

![S3 to AWS Lambda diagram](/img/event-sources/s3-lambda.png)

In this pattern, we will walk through how to trigger AWS Lambda from S3 object events.

## Packages Required

```bash install
dotnet add package Amazon.Lambda.S3Events
```

## Function Code

The S3 to Lambda integration is what is known as an asynchronous invoke. Events are forwarded to the Lambda service and processed asynchronously, meaning the caller can continue doing other work.

The _`S3Event`_ object contains an array of _`S3EventNotification`_ objects. S3 Events are passed to Lambda in batches.

The _`S3EventNotification`_ object contains both an _`Bucket`_ and _`Object`_ property. It's important to note that the _`Object.Key`_ property will **always** be URL encoded. However, if you need to make a call to the S3 API then you need the URL decoded key string. That's caught me out many times ðŸ˜¢

```c# Function.cs
public class Function
{
    public async Task Handler(S3Event evt, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            if (evt.Records.Count <= 0)
            {
                context.Logger.LogLine("Empty S3 Event received");
                return;
            }

            foreach (var s3Object in evt.Records)
            {
                var bucket = evt.Records[0].S3.Bucket.Name;

                // The object key will always be URL encoded.
                // However, the API call to S3 requires a URL decoded string
                var key = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(evt.Records[0].S3.Object.Key);

                context.Logger.LogLine($"Request is for {bucket} and {key}");

                var objectResult = await _s3Client.GetObjectAsync(bucket, key);

                context.Logger.LogLine($"Key is {objectResult.Key}");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            context.Logger.LogLine($"Error processing request - {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Remember to URL decode your object key if you need to do any further work with the S3 API.
